+ Implement IRegisterable for Objects to be registered. Make sure it has got a register() method or delegate. Eventually, all block registration will be moved to this!

This let's me register recipes in a cleaner way. Down the road I'm guessing it'll be much cleaner for other objects to be registered too. Things like mod integration.
